**The Iterator Pattern** provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying
representation.

1. Create Iterator and Container interfaces.
2. Create concrete class implementing the Iterator and Container interface. 
3. Use the Container object to get iterator and call Iterator.
