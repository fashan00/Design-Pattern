**The Command Pattern** encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, 
queue or log requests, and support undoable oparations.

1. Create a Command interface.
2. Create a Receivers class.
3. Create concrete classes implementing the Command interface.
4. Create Invoker class.
5. Use the Invoker class to take and execute commands.
