**The Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

1. Create an Behaviors interface.
2. Create concrete classes implementing the same interface.
3. Create Context Class.
4. Use the Context to see change in behaviour when it changes its Strategy.
