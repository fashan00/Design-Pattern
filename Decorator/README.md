**The Decorator Pattern** attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

1. Create an Components interface.
2. Create concrete classes implementing the Components interface.
3. Create abstract Decorator class implementing the Components interface.
4. Create concrete Decorator class extending the abstract Decorator class.
5. Use the Decorator classes to decorate the objects.
