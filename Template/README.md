**The Template Method Pattern** defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

1. Create an abstract class with a template method being final.
2. Create concrete classes extending the above class.
3. Use the Template method to demonstrate a defined way.
