**The Facade Pattern** provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

1. Create an interface.
2. Create concrete classes implementing the same interface.
3. Create a facade class and use the facade to include various types.
