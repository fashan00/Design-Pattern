**The Observer Pattern** defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, 
all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

1. Create Subject class.
2. Create Observer abstract class.
3. Create concrete observer classes.
4. Use Subject and concrete observer objects.
