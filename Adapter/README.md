**The Adapter Pattern** converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect.
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

1. Create two interfaces A, B.
2. Create concrete classes implementing the interfaces.
3. Create Adapter class implementing the interface A.
4. Use Adapter to call the classes implementing of interface B.
